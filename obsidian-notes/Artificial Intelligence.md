### What is an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT)?

A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand and generate human language. It uses advanced machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning, to process and generate text. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, articles, and other sources to learn the patterns, structures, and nuances of human language.

Large language models like GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) have billions of parameters, which are the tunable settings that allow the model to capture complex linguistic relationships. These models can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including but not limited to:

1. Text generation: They can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt or input.
    
2. Language translation: They can translate text from one language to another.
    
3. Text summarization: They can create concise summaries of longer texts.
    
4. Sentiment analysis: They can determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
    
5. Question answering: They can provide answers to questions posed in natural language.
    
6. Chatbot interactions: They can engage in conversation and respond to user inputs in a human-like manner.
    
7. Language understanding: They can comprehend and analyze the meaning of text, including identifying entities, relationships, and concepts.

The development of large language models represents a significant advancement in AI and natural language processing, as they have the potential to perform tasks that previously required extensive human intervention. However, they also raise important ethical and social considerations related to biases in the training data, potential misuse, and the implications for the job market, among other issues.

## What does Hacker News think?

##### commenting on ChatGPT providing a patently false answer to a question
> ChatGPT does not lie; it cannot lie.  
It was given a sequence of words and tasked with producing a subsequent sequence of words that satisfy with high probability the constraints of the model.  
It did that admirably. It's not its fault, or in my opinion OpenAI's fault, that the output is being misunderstood and misused by people who can't be bothered understanding it and project their own ideas of how it should function onto it.

### What do the Markets think?
  
From Bloomberg;
  
> The latest artificial-intelligence hype is powering a massive surge in the stock market on bets that a new era of innovation is nigh. Yet for money managers who weaponize computing advances for an investing edge, the era of ChatGPT holds a less lofty promise for now: Automating the grunt work. “They are very strong for code completion, editing, finding errors and fixing bugs,” said Kevin Cole, chief executive of systematic hedge fund Campbell & Co. “Our model would keep humans in the loop—an assistant to the human helping to make their job more efficient.”

### Some examples of what you CAN do with AI in this class
1) For your final project
	1) Generating sample or test data
	2) Generating tests for your project code, if you decide to write them
	3) Generating simple boilerplate code to get you started quickly.  Using ChatGPT to create a basic flask page in python is probably fine.
2) Studying for exams
3) Toil reduction.  If you find yourself repeating mundane tasks over and over, AI to the rescue!
4) General reference, and getting more familiarity with concepts that the book (or the instructor) may do a poor job of explaining.  Caveat: Not everything is says will be correct, so be cautious!

### Some examples of what I CANNOT do with AI in this class
1) Do your homework for you.  Do this yourself.
2) Submitting answers to take-home exam questions.  This should be your own work.
3) Submitting any work product, source code, or anything else without attributing it to the source (e.g. the AI engine you used to get the content).
4) Generating SQL queries.  This is a skill you need to practice, don't let robots do this for you.
5) Generating SQL schemas.  I've found this is easier to spot than you might think.
6) Anything directly aligned to the documented course learning objectives in the syllabus.  Learn this stuff! It's important!
7) If you don't understand the output, DON'T USE IT.  This is a huge danger of these tools.  They frequently spit out nonsense, and if you aren't 100% sure the answer is correct, disregard it.  Don't let the amazing wordsmithing fool you, be smarter than that!
